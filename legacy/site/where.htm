        <div class="step">1. Check your distribution's repository</div>
        <p>AppTools is open-source software and therefore it may be found in your distribution's main software
        repository.  We recommend first checking your distribution's repository before using alternative methods.
        A list is maintained below of distributions that are known to make AppTools available through their
        repositories:</p>
        <p><em>There are no known distributions.</em></p>
        <div class="step">2. Download AppFS package</div>
        <p>AppTools is also available as an installable AppFS package.  You don't need AppTools already installed
        to install this package (i.e. you can run the package without AppTools).  This is the recommended method
        if you are an end-user and your distribution does not currently make AppTools available.</p>
        <p><em>There is no AppFS package available yet.</em></p>
        <div class="step">3. Download source code</div>
        <p>If you've got a C++ compiler handy and want to compile from source, you can check out the source code
        from our Subversion repository at Google Code.</p>
